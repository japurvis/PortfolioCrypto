# PortfolioCrypto
An excel based crypto management tool using exchange APIs (Coinbase/GDAX/Bittrex/Binance) to create a Dashboard, Portfolio, Orders, Transfers, Trades, and Capital Gains for taxes.


I spent the last few months working on this to get it ready to calculate my capital gains for taxes as an alternative to paying a 3rd party to do so.  I'm making this available to the public to help others as well.  Please feel free to enhance and add other exchange APIs.


If you find this tool beneficial, especially for tax purposes, please consider donating to one of my coinbase addresses below.
